"""
In this problem, you are given a time of the day and the goal is to calculate the total number of seconds, that have passed since the day started.

Remember that one hour has 3,600 seconds, and one minute has 60 seconds. So, for example, at 03:16 the total number of seconds that have passed since the day started is equal to:

3×3,600 + 16 × 60 = 11
,
760
Using the same way as above, compute the total number of seconds at 12:30. Print the results to the screen."""


print((12 * 3600) + (30 * 60))
